# Secure Text Encryption Program
An Encryption and Decryption program created to process text files with either a shift cipher or polyalphabetic method. This was created for encrypting files to send to clients where they would be decrypted.

By entering the name of the file in the program, selecting the encryption / decryption method, a file will be output in the directory of the program containing the exact text in the original file, only encrypted and vice versa.
